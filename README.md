https://damianjacob.github.io/CI-MS2-fun-Quiz/

The goal of this project is to create an interactive website that contains a quiz game. The site is targeted towards people of all ages who want to have fun and test their knowledge.

## User Goals
1. Have fun with an interactive game
2. Test their knowledge
3. Try to beat the game
4.
## User Stories
1. "As a person who likes games, i expect this game to show my score and my remaining life points"
2. "As a user who has not played many online-games before, i want to see some instructions before playing"
3. "As a person interested in trivia, i want to see if i submitted the wrong response and i want to be shown the correct answer"
4. "As a user who really loves this game, i would like to follow its creator on social media to find out more about them"
5. "As a user who wants to beat the game, i expect to be able to decide myself when to go to the next question"
6. "As a gamer i expect the game to tell me when i've completed a section of it"
## Site Owner Goals
1. To have an good-looking site that incourages users to play
2. To have an clear layout and a page with instructions for the user
3. Have an intuitive interface
4. Have social media links in the site
5. Have a site that is responsive on all devices

## Design Choices
I wanted to create a site that looks fun but still clean.
## Colors
I have chosen a linear gradient for the entire page, from left to right. The gradient goes from a dark blue to violet, which is not a drastic change. After experimenting with colors, i've decided to keep the header and footer in the same color as the rest of the page, and to separate them from the rest of tha page with a double border.
## Fonts
I used Zen Dots for the logo and the lato font for the body of my page. Zen Dots is a very particular font that makes the logo stand out, but it wouldn't be very legible if the entire page was in this font. Lato is perfect for the body, as it is a well readable sans-serif font.
## Structure
The first thing that should jump to the user's attention should be the logo, that's why i i placed it in the top left corner, larger than the rest of the text and with a particular font (zen dots).

After that, there is the navigation menu in the following order: Home, Instruments, About Us, Contact Us and Newsletter.
On the homepage there is some essential information about the shop Music Pro: first of all a nice hero image that gives an immediate sense of what the site is about. 
Immediately below, the user will find more information about what services and type of products the shop offers.
Finally, there are a map of where to find the shop and the opening hours. These are probably the information which should be the fastest to find: i can imagine that a user might just come onto the site to check the opening hours or the location of the shop. 
Next on the nav  bar is the core of the site: the instrument selection. All instruments can be browsed on this site, and there is a second nav bar which allows the user to quickly jump to the category they want.  
Each instrument has its name, the price, some essential information and a buy button.
The third link on the nav bar brings the user to the About Us page: This is where they can learn more about the shop and its founders. It gives the site a more human aspect and makes it more relatable.
Finally, in the contact page the user can find all the relevant information for contacting the shop and a form for any queries.

## Wireframes
I used balsamiq for the wireframes. Since some aspects of the project changed while i was making it, i created an updated wireframe to make sure it reflected the site accurately.

## Features
### Existing features

- Nav Bar
   Featured on all the pages of the site, the responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, About Us and Contact Us page and is identical in each page in order to make the navigation easy.
   This allows the user to easily reach every page without having to resort to the "back" button. ![nav-bar](https://github.com/Damianjacob/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/blob/master/assets/images/readme-images/Navbar.png?raw=true)  
   The nav bar is responsive and will transform into a hamburger menu on smaller screen sizes.

- Home page hero image
   This hero image contains a beautiful image of a guitar on fire. ![hero-image](https://github.com/Damianjacob/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/blob/master/assets/images/readme-images/hero-image.png?raw=true)  

- Home page description section
   This section explains the user what exactly the shop offers. It gives precise information about what the user can expect to find at the shop or in the page.![description](https://github.com/Damianjacob/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/blob/master/assets/images/readme-images/description.png?raw=true)  

- Opening hours and Google Maps iframe
   This section give the user vital information: when the shop is open and a direct link to google maps. This makes it easy for the user to get directions. ![opening-hours](https://github.com/Damianjacob/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/blob/master/assets/images/readme-images/openinghours-map.png?raw=true)  

- Footer
   The footer contains direct links to social media sites. This encourages the user to interact with the shop through these sites. ![footer](https://github.com/Damianjacob/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/blob/master/assets/images/readme-images/footer.png)

- Instruments navigation bar
   On this page, the user can scroll freely through all the available products, but the instruments navigation bar is very useful because it allows the user to jump to any category in the page. ![instrument-navbar](https://github.com/Damianjacob/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/blob/master/assets/images/readme-images/instruments-navbar.png?raw=true)  
   The instruments nav bar is responsive and will become vertical and move to the side on smaller screen sizes.

- Instruments grid
   The instruments grid is an easy way for the user to see all the products offered by the music shop. ![instruments-section](https://github.com/Damianjacob/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/blob/master/assets/images/readme-images/instruments-section.png?raw=true)  

- About Us page
   This page contains a brief description of the store and provides a bit of a backstory to it. This can create a stronger connection between the user and the store. ![about-us](https://github.com/Damianjacob/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/blob/master/assets/images/readme-images/about-us.png?raw=true)  


- Contact us page
   This page contains all the necessary information for the user to contact the store, it also has a form for any user question or communication. ![contact-us](https://github.com/Damianjacob/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/blob/master/assets/images/readme-images/contact-us-form.png) ![contact-us](https://github.com/Damianjacob/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/blob/master/assets/images/readme-images/contact-us-info.png)

### ACCESSIBILITY
There is one error because of an empty form label on index.html, however i need that label to stay empty for my responsive nav bar to show correctly as a hamburger menu.  The same goes for the instruments.html page in the buy modal: there are empty labels because i used icons from font awesome for those labels.
### LIGHTHOUSE
All of the pages in this site have achieved a score over 90 in performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO.

### Fixed errors
There have been some errors which i needed to fix:
- HTML: I had used the same id for multiple elements on the instrument page. Both were related to the modal forms: i had used id=fname and id=lname in both modals. I fixed this by renaming the elements in the buy modal and pointing their labels accordingly.
- CSS: I had mistakenly used the rule "background-repeat: no" for 4 different background images. This is incorrect and i changed it to "background-repeat: no-repeat".
- Accessibility: The newsletter button had a low contrast error, so i changed its color in order to obtain a better contrast.
- Lighthouse: the performance of my site was suffering because i had used high-resolution images with a width of around 4000px. I reduced all images with a free online resource (https://www.befunky.com/features/resize-image/) to slightly above their max-width. This allowed my performace to reach a score of over 90.

## Bugs

The hardest bug to resolve was with the grid elements on the about-us.html and contact-us.html pages: once the viewport dropped below 800px (which is my breakpoint for tablets and mobile phones), the grid element overflowed to the right. It was very time consuming to try to figure out what the problem was, and once i discovered that it was overflowing thanks to the help of our tutor support, i tried changing the space and height rules with CSS. This still did not help, so i decided to set the display of the grid container to absolute and position it on the page. This created another bug: when reducing the height of the viewport, some of the content would overlap. I resolved this problem partially by changing the min-height from "100vh" to a set amount of px. There is still a part in my about-us page where the content overflows slightly over the background image at the very bottom (only with smaller screen sizes).

## Deployment
The site was deployed to Github pages. See the live link: https://damianjacob.github.io/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/index.html

### Content
   I took used the modal bootstrap from https://getbootstrap.com/ and followed the documentation from that site to modify the code of the bootstrap. I often referred back to various lessons from Code Institute and to W3schools or MDN.
   For the responsive nav bar using only CSS i followed this tutorial by Kevin Powell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QKOaTYvYUA

### Media
   All the photos used on the site have been downloaded from one of the following copyright-free sites: Unsplash, StockVault, Pixabay. This includes the pictures of the icons for the social media links. 
   The icons have been taken from font awesome.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank my co-students who took their time to answer my questions or doubts on Slack, my mentor Mo Shami who gave me precious advice and lent me his expertise and the tutors of code Institute who helped me understand the origin of two bugs which i then could fix.
